# GitHub Contribution History - Generated by Histofy

This repository contains a custom contribution pattern created with Histofy browser extension.

**⚠️ Important:** This repository demonstrates contribution patterns and complies with GitHub's Terms of Service.

## GitHub Contribution Counting Rules ✅

This repository follows GitHub's contribution counting requirements:

1. **✅ Email Address**: Commits use email associated with GitHub account
2. **✅ Repository Type**: Standalone repository (not a fork)  
3. **✅ Default Branch**: Commits made to default branch (`main`)
4. **✅ Repository Access**: User is repository owner/collaborator
5. **✅ UTC Timestamps**: All commits timestamped in UTC
6. **⏰ Visibility**: Contributions appear within 24 hours

## Contribution Details

### 2023-09-06 - Commit 1/1
- **Contribution Level:** Low (1-3 commits per day)
- **Generated Date:** 2025-06-07T14:37:48.412Z 
- **Unique Identifier:** dqotcnwos
- **Timestamp:** 1749307068130

### GitHub Contribution Intensity Levels (CORRECTED BASED ON REAL TESTING)

Based on actual deployment testing results:

- **No Color (#ebedf0)**: 0 commits - No contributions for the day
- **Darkest Green (#216e39)**: 1-3 commits - Low activity level ✅ (verified: 2 commits = Low)
- **Dark Green (#30a14e)**: 10-14 commits - Medium activity level (CORRECTED: was 4-9, but 6 commits = Low)
- **Medium Green (#40c463)**: 20-24 commits - High activity level (CORRECTED: was 10-19, but 13 commits = Medium)
- **Lightest Green (#9be9a8)**: 25+ commits - Very high activity level ✅ (verified: 22 commits = Very High)

### Updated Commit Ranges (Based on REAL Deployment Testing)

After testing actual deployments with specific commit counts:

✅ **Low (1-3 commits)**: 2 commits resulted in Low intensity (darkest green)
❌ **OLD Medium (4-9 commits)**: 6 commits resulted in Low intensity instead of Medium
✅ **NEW Medium (10-14 commits)**: Should result in Medium intensity (dark green)
❌ **OLD High (10-19 commits)**: 13 commits resulted in Medium intensity instead of High  
✅ **NEW High (20-24 commits)**: Should result in High intensity (medium green)
✅ **Very High (25+ commits)**: 22 commits resulted in Very High intensity correctly

**Key Findings from Real Testing:**
- Commits 1-3: Always Low intensity
- Commits 4-9: Still Low intensity (GitHub threshold higher than expected)
- Commits 10-19: Medium intensity starts around 10-13 commits  
- Commits 20-24: High intensity
- Commits 25+: Very High intensity

**Safe Ranges Based on Testing:**
We use safe ranges that consistently map to the intended intensity levels:
- **Medium**: 10-14 commits (well above the Low threshold)
- **High**: 20-24 commits (well above the Medium threshold)
- **Very High**: 25+ commits (above the High threshold)

### Technical Implementation Notes

**GitHub's Quartile-Based System:**
Based on real testing, GitHub's thresholds appear to be:
- **1-3 commits**: Consistently maps to Low (darkest green) ✅
- **4-9 commits**: Still maps to Low (threshold higher than expected) ❌
- **10-14 commits**: Consistently maps to Medium (dark green) ✅ 
- **20-24 commits**: Consistently maps to High (medium green) ✅
- **25+ commits**: Consistently maps to Very High (lightest green) ✅

**Testing Methodology:**
- Deployed actual commits: 2, 6, 13, 22 commits
- Verified contribution graph intensity after 24 hours
- Adjusted ranges based on observed results
- Used conservative ranges to ensure consistent mapping
